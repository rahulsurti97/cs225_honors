The Case of the Thieving Roommate

'Twas noon after the last day of school and not a creature was stirring, not even...your roommate.  That's weird, he's always up and about at this time.  You crack open your eyes and see that not only is your roommate gone, but his entire half of the room has been cleared out!

You’re confused at first because he didn’t mention that he’d be moving out next semester, but then you realize that your brand new laptop, cellphone, and wallet are all missing from your desk.

Furious, you jump up and get dressed, knowing you have to track this guy down before he drives home for winter break at 6 PM tonight! You don’t even know where to start, but you know you have to get moving. Hurry before time runs out!

## Description

Gameplay: navigate throughout the University of Illinois meeting people who you never thought would help you foil the plan of your thieving roommate and get your belongings back!

With 15 specific locations around campus and 15 different commands, there are endless ways to play this game!  Solve the puzzle of figuring out where to go next; one wrong turn or forgotten item will leave the storyline locked!

Have fun!
